# Divine Fury

This mod adds a new charm to Hollow Knight: Divine Fury.

Divine Fury sets the player's health to 1, making it easier to trigger Fury of the Fallen in Godhome battles.

This charm can be acquired via the All Charms option in DebugMod.

WARNING - This mod uses ItemChanger, and therefore requires a new Save in order to take effect.
